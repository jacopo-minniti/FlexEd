## Context
This is the deliverable for FE51.
## Purpose
Flex Education is born as a project for _learning outside the classroom_. The idea is: that instead of giving users a random course for learning, we give them different resources, material, context, and exercises to learn by themselves. All of this is done together with strong customization: based on the user's previous knowledge and skills, the content and exercises given are different for their difficulty. The final product is a learning roadmap build for every single user. 
## Tech Stack  
- Frontend: _Dart_ with _Flutter_ Framework.
- Backend: Firebase
- Database: Firestore (NoSQL Database)
## Next Steps 
- Building an AI algorithm to make the customization more powerful
- Make the app more consistent
- Add a community feature
